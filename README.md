# Air-Purifier-Product-Market-Fit-Pan-India-Ananlysis
# This was an open source, 16th resume project challenge conducted by 'Code Basics' data learning platform. Total 2029 participants participated in this challenge.

"AirPure Innovations" is a startup born out of the air quality crisis in India, with 14 cities ranking among the world’s top 20 most polluted urban centers. The company is in the early stages of product development and is unsure whether there is a strong, sustained demand for its air purifier product. Before committing to production and R&D, they need to answer critical questions:

1. What pollutants or particles should their air purifier target?
2. What are the most essential features that should be incorporated into the air purifier?
3. Which cities have the highest demand for air purifiers, and what is the market size in these regions?
4. How can R&D be aligned with localized pollution patterns?

The three dimensions to be analyzed are:
1. Severity Mapping: Identify cities experiencing persistent or worsening AQI (Air Quality Index) levels.
2. Health Impact Correlation: Quantify the health burden due to pollution and its impact on consumers' well-being.
3. Demand Triggers: Examine the relationship between pollution spikes and shifts in consumer behavior related to air purifier demand.

While searching for reliable, real-time AQI data, the team discovered the "Dataful" platform, which provides datasets essential for answering these questions.

Task:
• Check ‘primary_and_secondary_questions.pdf’. You can use any tool of your choice (Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, Excel, PowerPoint) to analyse and answer these questions. More relevant instructions are provided in this document.
• Design a dashboard with your metrics and analysis. The end users of this dashboard are top-level management and the product strategy team - hence, the dashboard should be self-explanatory and easy to understand.
• Present your insights to Tony Sharma & team. Be creative and concise with your presentation.
• Use your dashboard in the presentation along with the deck.
• Use additional data based on your own research to support your recommendations.

# Primary Analysis (Based on Available data): 
1.	List the top 5 and bottom 5 areas with the highest average AQI. (Consider the areas which contain data from the last 6 months: December 2024 to May 2025) 
2.	List out the top 2 and bottom 2 prominent pollutants for each state of southern India. (Consider data post-COVID: 2022 onwards) 
3.	Does AQI improve on weekends vs weekdays in Indian metro cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune)? (Consider data from the last 1 year) 
4.	Which months consistently show the worst air quality across Indian states — (Consider the top 10 states with high distinct areas) 
5.	For the city of Bengaluru, how many days fell under each air quality category (e.g., Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.) between March and May 2025? 
6.	List the top two most reported diseases or illnesses in each state over the past three years, along with the corresponding average Air Quality Index (AQI) for that period. 
7.	List the top 5 states with high EV adoption and analyse if their average AQI is significantly better compared to states with lower EV adoption 

# Secondary Analysis (This will require additional data and research) 
1.	Which age group is most affected by air pollution-related health outcomes, and how does this vary by city? 
2.	Who are the major competitors in the Indian air purifier market, and what are their key differentiators (e.g., price, filtration stages, smart features)?
3.	What is the relationship between a city’s population size and its average AQI — do larger cities always suffer from worse air quality? (Consider 2024 population and AQI data for this) 
4.	How aware are Indian citizens of what AQI (Air Quality Index) means, and do they understand its health implications? 
5.	Which pollution control policies introduced by the Indian government in the past 5 years have had the most measurable impact on improving air quality, and how have these impacts varied across regions or cities? 

# Extra details
•	Priority Cities: Which Tier 1/2 cities show irreversible AQI degradation? 
•	Health Burden: How do AQI spikes correlate with paediatric asthma admissions?
•	Behaviour Shifts: Do pollution emergencies increase purifier searches/purchases? 
•	Feature Gap: What do existing products lack (e.g., smart AQI syncing, compact designs)?

# Deliverables: 
Market Prioritization Dashboard with:
•	City risk scores (AQI severity × population density × income) 
•	Health cost impact projections 
•	Competitor feature gap matrix 

Product Requirements Document specifying: 
•	Must-have features (e.g., PM2.5/VOC sensors)
•	Tiered pricing models for target segments
